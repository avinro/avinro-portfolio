 * WorkDivider — chapter break between HomeHero and SelectedWork.
 *
 * Renders a CurvedLoop marquee so the page has a clear chapter transition.
 * The CurvedLoop component is lazy-loaded (`ssr: false`) because it relies
 * on SVG text measurement (getComputedTextLength) which only works in the
 * browser. The fallback is a simple invisible spacer that preserves vertical
 * rhythm without a layout shift.
 *
 * Reduced-motion users see the text on its curved SVG path statically
 * (the CurvedLoop wrapper halts the rAF loop when useReducedMotion is true).
 *
 * aria-hidden="true" is applied in CurvedLoop itself — this is decorative
 * content; the information it carries ("Selected Work") is already in the
 * section heading below.
